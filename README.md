The page will reload when you make changes.  
You may also see lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.  
It bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.  
The build is minified and filenames include the hashes.  
Your app is ready to be deployed!

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**  
This command will copy all configuration files and dependencies into your project so you have full control over them.
